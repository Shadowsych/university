# Extras
Just a few extra lectures to understand about the Java programming language.
- Most of the extra content is just control structures to make programming easier
- Mike Scott (my CS312 and CS314 lecturer) hasn't touched too much into the lectures in this folder, but I thought it was important to know for my future career

We'll write about Heaps later this week, for now I need to focus on my Huffman assignment.

Look at textbook for notes about Heaps.

Some things to note about Heaps:
- A Heap is a complete binary tree, but not always a complete BST
- Used to create PriorityQueues
- Min/Max Heaps (Heap order property)
- Uses Array container (also note the equations)

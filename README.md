# University
This folder showcases my notes, code, and research I accumulated throughout my studies at The University of Texas at Austin. As of right now, I'm an aspiring B.S. Computer Science student.

### Disclaimer of Courses
Some courses may not be listed in this repository because they have their own repository (such as CS 312 and CS 314) on my GitHub.  
If this is true, then it's most likely that the course took too much space on this repository and was given its own repository.

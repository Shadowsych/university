# University
This folder showcases my notes, code, and research I accumulated throughout my studies at The University of Texas at Austin. As of right now, I'm an aspiring B.S. Computer Science student.

### Disclaimer of Courses
Some courses may not be listed in this repository because they have their own repository on my GitHub.  
- It's most likely that the course took too much space on this repository and was given its own repository
- For example, CS 312 and CS 314 have a separate repository
